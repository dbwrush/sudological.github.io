A while back I decided to try out the Godot game engine. It's free and open source, and you know I love FOSS! You can read about Godot <a href="https://godotengine.org/">here</a> by the way. Super cool project that I intend to do more wtih in the future.

Anyway, on my <a href="https://sudologic.net/java_games.html">Java Games</a> page there is mention of a game I simply called 'Space Shooter'. Think Galaga but with resource management. It's a neat project, except that you need Java installed to play it, but Godot can fix that! I re-made the game in Godot in some downtime between work and school, click <a href="https://files.dbwrush.com/s/WHbE8c5qsxwXJHj" download>here</a> to download the game!

This isn't a fully polished project that I'd release on Steam, so you won't find instructions on how to play it. I'm sure you can figure it out.
