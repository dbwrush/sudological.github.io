Hello!
It has been a <i>LONG</i> time since I last worked on this plugin, but I intend to return to Minecraft plugin development.
<br>
That starts with ElytraDogfights 1.5.3, which ensures compatibility with Minecraft 1.18.
I'll be making a video documenting the plugin in full sometime soon, along with a post on this site explaining installation and customization.
<br>
You can download the new ElytraDogfights release <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/elytra-dogfights.60491/">here!</a>
