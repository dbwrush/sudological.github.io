##I just got the email this afternoon, Valve has finished testing Collect Call's compatibility for the Steam Deck!

From the beginning, Collect Call was intended for the Deck, so I'm glad it's finally verified.

They did leave a note though, it seems the game does not automatically switch to a different controller once you start playing. I plan on releasing a small patch later this week to fix it.

Collect Call is free on Steam!
