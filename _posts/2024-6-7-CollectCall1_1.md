description: Lots of little changes that nobody but I will notice...

Upon any game's release there will be a handful of bugs that get discovered, Collect Call was no different. Math, a friend of mine, discovered a bug where the game would fail to load a save file created on the final level. I also decided that some of Collect Call's code might be reusable in another project, currently titled "Alignment", but I'd need to spruce it up a bit. I cloned Collect Call's Git repository and began making the necessary changes to make it into a more functional 'engine', and ended up patching some of Collect Call's bugs as I did.

Collect Call is free on Steam!
