title: Empires!
description: Got bored. Made a sim.

A while back I found a fun website that could simulate wars between empires on a world map. You could watch them grow and decline, form alliances, explore territory. But a few things I wanted to change.

The first thing that bothered me was that the empires, or 'colonies' as the site called them, would often not base their conflicts or alliances on mutually shared values. They seemed mostly random.
The second issue was performance. The website slowed to a crawl if you had it simulate a very detailed world, sometimes you could measure it in seconds per frame rather than frames per second!
The third thing was that the site didn't give you a great visualization of what the colonies were thinking, how they were planning their next move.

So, over the last weekend, I decided to make my own version. It's super rough for the moment, but it is a thing!

Quick rundown of the view modes.
You press the corresponding number key to switch mode.

1: Empire colors
2: Strength of each pixel
3: Empire ideology
4: Resource management
5: Time since last capture
6: Border friction

If you're interested in trying it out, I've got a download on <a href="https://www.github.com/sudological/Empires">GitHub</a>. It's written in Java, so you'll need to have the JDK or JRE installed. Leave requests on the repo if you like, maybe I'll expand this thing.
