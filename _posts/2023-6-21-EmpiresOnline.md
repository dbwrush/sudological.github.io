The Empires simulation I posted about a while back is now online so you can run it in a web browser. Try it <a href="https://empires.sudologic.net/">HERE!</a> If you're curious about it, press F12 to view the source code. If you have suggestions, you post them as Issues to the <a href="https://github.com/sudological/empiresOnline">GitHub</a> repository or on my <a href="https://sudologic.net/discord">Discord server</a>.
