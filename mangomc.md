In 2022 I launched a Minecraft server called MangoMC, using some previous work by Math0424 and Hallflower as a base. 

The server's focus is to be the community's server, we welcome players to get involved in growing the server and choosing its direction.

If you are interested in helping me grow the server, reach out! 

You can read more about MangoMC at <a href="https://mangomc.net">its own website</a>, or join it yourself! The server is Java edition, with Bedrock support through Geyser.
If you play both Java and Bedrock, look into <a href="https://link.geysermc.org/">Account Linking</a> so you can use the same inventory across both!

Server address is play.mangomc.net!
